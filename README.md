# Build and host a REST API (Method: POST) that takes in an array and returns the output in given format (Done using Python)

This project is a REST API built with Flask to handle a POST request at the `/bfhl` route.

### 1. Entire Output Working in Postman

- The API is fully functional and tested using **Postman**.
- Correct output is being returned in the required format.

Screenshot of Postman output is included in the repository and attached below.
